# SURFr-Sequence-Alignment

All source code for the local GUI implementation of the SURFr RNA-Sequence Alignment (RNA-Seq) software developed by Nick 
Campbell under Dr. Jingshan Huang of the University of South Alabama School of Computing and Dr. Glen Borchert of 
the Whiddon College of Medicine within the University of South Alabama. 

NOTE - This application was built and tested on Ubuntu 22.04. There is currently no support for Windows or Mac OS.

To give these cutting-edge algorithms a try, download the source code in the repo and, in a Python virtual environment with Python 3.10, install the following libraries using pip:
  Numpy,
  Scipy,
  Cython,
  Pyahocorasick,
  PyQt5,
  Biopython,
  MatPlotLib.
  
Once the source code is downloaded and all external libraries are installed in the virtual environment, 
run **python Main.py** to launch the application.
